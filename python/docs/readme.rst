Basic Information
=================

What is it
----------

This is GridGain ML client library, written in Python 3, abbreviated as *ggml*.

`GridGain`_ is a memory-centric distributed database, caching, and processing platform for transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte scale.

GridGain ML client library provides user applications the ability to work with GridGain ML functionality using `Py4J`_ as an integration mechanism.

Prerequisites
-------------

- *Python 3.4* or above (3.6 is tested),
- IGNITE_HOME environment variable with path to Apache Ignite.

Installation
------------

for end user
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to use *ggml* in your project, you may install it from PyPI:

::

$ pip install ggml

for developer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to run tests, examples or build documentation, clone the whole repository:

::

$ git clone git@github.com:apache/ignite.git
$ cd ignite/modules/ml/python
$ pip install -e .

This will install the repository version of *ggml* into your environment in so-called “develop” or “editable” mode. You may read more about `editable installs`_ in the pip manual.
