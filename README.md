# GridGain ML Python API

GridGain ML Python API consists of two parts:

* ML Python API Java, contains Java wrappers required by Python API to work with Ignite ML library. This part can be found in `ml-python-api` directory. It should be built and then placed into `libs` folder of the Apache Ignite binary release.
* ML Python API Python, contains Python library with classes allowed to work with Ignite ML using Python API.
